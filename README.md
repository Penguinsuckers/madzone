# Madzone

Madzone is a simplistic dungeon crawler game made with Unity.
Fight in randomly generated levels, upgrade your weapons and survive the deepest caves.


The game will be made downloadable with the Github Realease system.
If you want to build it yourself, you will need the Unity software installed. Simply
clone the repository, open it as a Unity project, and it'll be ready to build!


We do not own Unity or any related Unity technologies in any manner or sort.
